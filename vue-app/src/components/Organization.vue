      The workshop is organised as an interactive and participatory hack-a-thon.
      The focus of the workshop is on creating designs and prototypes within the workshop itself.

<!--       The preliminary schedule for the workshop is summarised in Table~\ref{tab:schedule}.
 -->

<!--       The main purpose of the session in the morning is to acquaint the participants with each other and to discuss the ideas for future crowd-powered design creativity support systems contributed by the participants.

      After the welcome and a short interactive introduction of the participants, participants will be introduced with a hypothetical yet realistic design scenario and will be asked to brainstorm interaction models to support design creativity using helpful insights from the crowd.

      Following this exercise, participants will discuss their contributed ideas and will form teams around a subset of the ideas.

      The afternoon is occupied by collaborative work in smaller groups. The purpose of these break-out sessions is to sketch out ideas or even build first prototypes of user interfaces and crowd-powered creativity support systems.
      In a final presentation, the teams will present their solutions and designs to the group.

      The workshop does not require a special venue or hard- ware.
      Only a projector is required (which the organisers can bring, if needed).
      The workshop organisers will bring a set of supporting materials
      (stationary items and grid sheets) to support the hands-on sketching and design of low fidelity paper prototypes and mockups.
      The organizers will further support the participants with a set of crowdsourcing  design heuristics in the form of playing cards. -->
