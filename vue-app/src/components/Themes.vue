    <p class="lead">
We structure the workshop around the design process with its four key phases:
<a href="#Ideation">Ideation</a>, <a href="#Exploration">Exploration</a>, <a href="#Optimization">Optimization</a>, <a href="#Reflection">Reflection</a>.
Please note that many times these phases overlap with each other and are executed in cycles. Still, there exists a fine boundary between each, demanding a specific structure to the design tasks.

The common challenges under these four themes include, but are not limited to, proposing user interfaces and systems
for:
<ul style="text-align:left">
  <li>
     preventing cognitive overload of the individual designer,

  <li>
     efficiently communicating and explaining design criteria and constraints to the crowd,

  <li>
     \item supporting peak-productive moments ("bursts") of an individual's creativity with the collective intelligence of the crowd,
  </li>
  <li>
     \textit{e.g.} the selection among design alternatives,

  <li>
     \item automating repetitive tasks in group ideation, and

     \item designing concepts for interaction and collaboration between Artificial Intelligence and human agents in creative tasks.%

        Design ideation involves, but is not limited to gathering relevant information, building initial design criteria, defining design constraints and developing inspirational and creative stimuli for innovative and creative design thinking.
      </p>
      <p>
        Under this theme, we welcome % researchers, designers and practitioners to submit ideas addressing and exploring interactive ways to support the act of design ideation using collective insights of the crowd. The goal of this theme is to augment the designer's creativity and cognition during ideation with the crowd. The theme aims to develop improved software and user interfaces that empower designers to be more productive and more innovative.

        Design exploration many times is considered as part of the ideation. It comes after the introduction of preliminary design criteria, based on which expert designers generate a set of base design solutions. These base solutions become seed geometries to generate a large design space comprised of hundreds and thousands of design alternatives. This exploration may lead to re-definition of the preliminary design criteria and designers may move back and forth between ideation and exploration, until a complete understanding of the design space is achieved.
      </p>
      <p>
        In this theme, we invite researchers to submit ideas related to crowdsourcing the process of 
        exploration of the solution space.
        We are interested to investigate how the creation of design alternatives can be supported by a heterogeneous crowd with diverse skill sets.

        Exploration and Optimisation both rely heavily on the preliminary design ideation. Optimisation refers to the act of reducing the design space based on selective constraints. Once a satisfying design is achieved the designer may proceed with modifying or optimising the selected design to achieve maximum performance output.

      <p>
        This theme invites, but is not limited to, papers related to crowdsourcing the design optimisation processes and supporting convergent thinking with the crowd.

        Reflection refers to sensemaking and happens multiple times and often between frequent switching of design phases, due to the cyclic nature of a design process.
      </p>
      <p>
        This theme will explore interfaces supporting sensemaking and reflection on ideation, exploration and optimisation of design solutions with the collective intelligence of the crowd.
