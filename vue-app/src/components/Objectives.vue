In this workshop, we bring together scientists and practitioners interested in supporting creativity in different types of design scenarios through crowdsourcing. The one-day workshop is organised as a hands-on and participant-driven hack-a-thon event. We invite participants to bring forward their ideas already prior to the actual workshop and, during the workshop, design novel crowd-powered applications and user interfaces supporting designers in their design process. This may happen with either simple digital design tools or traditional paper prototyping. While the workshop theme focuses on creativity support through all design phases, we specifically encourage participants to think beyond the ideation phase of the design process. Doing so, we set to inspire the design of next-generation crowd-powered systems that support creativity in either a single or multiple design phases.The workshop theme fits well with several areas relevant to the conference theme, such as creativity support tools, Human-Computer Interaction, Social Computing, Crowdsourcing, Design Thinking, collaborative applications, co-creating environments and boundary-crossing designs.
